This is a basic PizzaDelivery system. It has a basic GIU. Multiple clients can connect to the server and make an order, 
each order is given a random time of completion, it can be changed so that the user/admin on the server side enters the time 
that takes the order to be completed. After the time is up the order is moved to the finished orders part, one more
section can be added for order delivered which can be entered by the delivery guy with his phone when he delivers the order.
Client side is a simple ordering system that sends back a message to the user of the estimated order delivery time.
